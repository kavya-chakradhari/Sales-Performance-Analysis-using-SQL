# Sales Performance Analysis of Walmart Stores Using Advanced MySQL Techniques  

## Overview  
This project analyzes Walmart’s transaction data to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiencies. Using advanced SQL queries, I performed detailed analysis across multiple dimensions such as branches, product lines, customer segments, and payment methods.  

The project demonstrates the use of complex SQL operations to answer real-world business questions and provide actionable insights.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains detailed records of Walmart transactions, including:  
- 1000 sales transactions
- 15 unique customers
- 3 branches (A, B, C)
- 6 product lines
- Time period: 3 months in 2019
